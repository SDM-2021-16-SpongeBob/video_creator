# Functional Specification

## Overview

This is a software based on Python-written processing video.

The technology used to write software is: Python, OpenCV and NumPy.

The purpose of the project is to provide a combined number of different videos and simply synchronize.

In many modern operating systems, in order to complete the above tasks, there is often a need for complex and huge software (for example: Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, Davinci Resolve, etc.), which there is still a lot of expensive software. Our software provides a foundation but free solution, mainly using Python and OpenCV, there is no other dependence.

## Current situation

This software is very useful, it can take several different video to a video.

At present, we have completed the basic function of the software, which can run in the command line.

## Glossary

-Python: Python is an interpreted, high-level general-purpose programming language.

-OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a programming function library that provides mainly real-time computer vision.

-NumPy: NumPy is a library in the Python programming language that supports large, multidimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a large collection of advanced mathematical functions to run on these arrays.

-Adobe Premiere Pro: Adobe Premiere Pro is a timeline-based video editing software developed by Adobe Inc.

-Final Cut Pro: Final Cut Pro is a series of nonlinear video editing software originally developed by Macromedia Inc. and later by Apple Inc.

-DaVinci Resolve: DaVinci Resolve is a color correction and nonlinear video editing (NLE) application for macOS, Windows and Linux. It was originally developed by da Vinci Systems and further developed by Blackmagic Design since its acquisition in 2009.

# System Design

## Goal of the system

The main goal of this program is to design a simple application for editing video (that is more than a few video to fit together and make simple synchronization).

Our ultimate goal is to make a video editing software similar to Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro.

## Project plan

## Business process model

## Requirements

## Functional plan

## Physical enviorement

## Architectural plan

## Implementation plan

## Testing plan

We plan to use CI (continuous integration) to automatically run test at each Commit and merge.

## Install plan

We will publish the package to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) when it is ready.

Then the user can download and install it by `pip`:

```shell
pip install video_creator
```

Developers can get the source code via Clone our Git Repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:SDM-2021-16-SpongeBob/video_creator.git
```

## Maintenance plan
 Following are the content of software development plan:

 -Processes:

    Typically, this would include your Software Development, Risk Management, Usability and Problem Resolution processes.

 -Required Resources:   
    
     Next, talk about the technical resources you need. At the minimum, you need a compiler or a runtime (e.g. CPython 3.8). You’ll probably also have some sort of IDE software.

 -Configuration Management:

     Describe how you do configuration management. Wait, what’s that? That’s simply what sort of version control software you use (I’d guess it’s git), how you name versions and how you create branches / merges during development.   

 -Verification Activities: 

     Software verification is yet another vague term, but for practical purposes, let’s just say that that refers to “code review” in human language.

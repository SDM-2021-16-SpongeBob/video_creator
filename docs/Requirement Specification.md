# Requirement Specification

## Overview

This is a software based on Python-written processing video.

The technology used to write software is: Python, OpenCV and NUMPY.

The purpose of the project is to provide a combined number of different videos and simply synchronize.

In many modern operating systems, in order to complete the above tasks, there is often a need for complex and huge software (for example: Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, Davinci Resolve, etc.), which there is still a lot of expensive software. Our software provides a foundation but free solution, mainly using Python and OpenCV, there is no other dependence.

## Current State

This software is very useful, it can take several different video to a video.

At present, we have completed the basic function of the software, which can run in the command line.

# Requirement Specification

## Overview

This is a software based on Python-written processing video.

The technology used to write software is: Python, OpenCV and NumPy.

The purpose of the project is to provide a combined number of different videos and simply synchronize.

In many modern operating systems, in order to complete the above tasks, there is often a need for complex and huge software (for example: Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, Davinci Resolve, etc.), which there is still a lot of expensive software. Our software provides a foundation but free solution, mainly using Python and OpenCV, there is no other dependence.

## Functional requirements
Video cropping, and the combination of videos

## Glossary

- Python: Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
- OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
- NumPy: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- Adobe Premiere Pro: Adobe Premiere Pro is a timeline-based video editing software application developed by Adobe Inc.
- Final Cut Pro: Final Cut Pro is a series of non-linear video editing software programs first developed by Macromedia Inc. and later Apple Inc.
- DaVinci Resolve: DaVinci Resolve is a color grading and non-linear video editing (NLE) application for macOS, Windows, and Linux, originally developed by da Vinci Systems, and now developed by Blackmagic Design following its acquisition in 2009.
